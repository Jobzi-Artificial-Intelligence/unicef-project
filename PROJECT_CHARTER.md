## 1: Guiding Principles

This project-charter file provides the content and informations necessary to identify the project in the context of its purpose, funding, resource requirements and approval. This document target audience is the major departmental stakeholders and decision makers in the leadership team.

## 2: Scope

Jobzi has knowledge and exprience to provide AI NLP solution designed to guide, contribute and merge the Job and Education market. As a part of this experience we are helping the Unicef and Giga a platform and AI prediction models to identify Internet availability in Brazilian schools using geographical data and information on employability for the schools' region.

### Objectives

The project's detailing and milestones were defined as follows:

- Quarter 1
    - Milestone 1 [Initial model to predict internet availability on Brazilian schools, based on information from GIGA (Backend and Frontend)]
        - Data cleaning
        - Additional geographical data acquisition
        - Initial model evaluation
        - Initial webpage with information on internet availability in Brazilian schools
    - Milestone 2 [Updated model to predict internet connectivity on Brazilian schools, based on information from GIGA and on regional employability data (backend and frontend)]
        - Data extraction
        - Feature engineering
        - Study of causuality between employability and connectivity variables via Bayesian networks
        - Model testing
        - Model selection
        - Data summarizing
        - Update webpage
    - Milestone 3 [Cohort Product Development]
        - Attend virtual technical product development session 
    - Milestone 4 [Communications and Branding]
        - 1 image + caption per month to be shared on your social media channels
        - 1 blog post at the beginning of the quarter
    - Milestone 5 [Meeting Open Source Contractual Requirement]
        - Determine licensing strategy for Open Source intellectual property (i.e. permissive or copyleft). Apply an Open Source Initiative-approved license to a public source code repository
        - Create a project charter. Project charters should include: vision statement, mission statement, community statement, licensing strategy, and identification of key trademarks
        - Create READMEs (in English) for all public repositories. READMEs should include: overview of specific repo, developer environment instructions (i.e. how to set software up), note about how repo connects into overall product, list of any Open Source software used to create product (including tools and frameworks)
        - Create a public, standalone Open Source documentation website that corresponds to a public git repository. Use tools to set up automated deployments of HTML documentation site from public source code repository (e.g. with Continuous Integration)
        - Follow the Pull Request Workflow when contributing code into your Open Source repositories.
