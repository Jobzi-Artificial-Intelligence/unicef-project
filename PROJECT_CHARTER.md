## 1: Guiding Principles

This project-charter file provides the content and informations necessary to identify the project in the context of its purpose, funding, resource requirements and approval. This document target audience is the major departmental stakeholders and decision makers in the leadership team.

## 2: Scope

Jobzi has knowledge and exprience to provide AI NLP solution designed to guide, contribute and merge the Job and Education market. As a part of this experience we are helping the Unicef and Giga a platform and AI prediction models to identify Internet availability in Brazilian schools using geographical data and information on employability for the schools' region.

### Objectives

The project's details and milestones were defined as follows:

- Quarter 1
    - Milestone 1 [Initial model to predict internet availability on Brazilian schools, based on information from GIGA (Backend and Frontend)]
        - Data cleaning
        - Additional geographical data acquisition
        - Initial model evaluation
        - Initial webpage with information on internet availability in Brazilian schools
    - Milestone 2 [Updated model to predict internet connectivity on Brazilian schools, based on information from GIGA and on regional employability data (backend and frontend)]
        - Data extraction
        - Feature engineering
        - Study of causuality between employability and connectivity variables via Bayesian networks
        - Model testing
        - Model selection
        - Data summarizing
        - Update webpage
    - Milestone 3 [Cohort Product Development]
        - Attend virtual technical product development session 
    - Milestone 4 [Communications and Branding]
        - 1 image + caption per month to be shared on your social media channels
        - 1 blog post at the beginning of the quarter
    - Milestone 5 [Meeting Open Source Contractual Requirement]
        - Determine licensing strategy for Open Source intellectual property (i.e. permissive or copyleft). Apply an Open Source Initiative-approved license to a public source code repository
        - Create a project charter. Project charters should include: vision statement, mission statement, community statement, licensing strategy, and identification of key trademarks
        - Create READMEs (in English) for all public repositories. READMEs should include: overview of specific repo, developer environment instructions (i.e. how to set software up), note about how repo connects into overall product, list of any Open Source software used to create product (including tools and frameworks)
        - Create a public, standalone Open Source documentation website that corresponds to a public git repository. Use tools to set up automated deployments of HTML documentation site from public source code repository (e.g. with Continuous Integration)
        - Follow the Pull Request Workflow when contributing code into your Open Source repositories.

- Quarter 2
    - Milestone 1 [Updated model to predict internet connectivity on Brazilian schools, based on information from GIGA, regional employability data, and additional data from external sources , (backend and frontend)]
        - Acquisiton of data from additional sources
        - Feature selection
        - Model testing
        - Model selection
        - Data summarizing
        - Update webpage
    - Milestone 2 [Meeting Open Source Contractual Requirement]
        - MUST have a OSI-approved license distributed with public source code repositories by end of Q2
        - Create contributing guidelines for all Open Source repositories. Explain how someone makes a contribution to the projects. Add to documentation website created in previous quarter
        - Create public tickets/issues that correspond to planned features and known bugs/problems with Open Source repositories
        - Establish an Open Source quality assurance process. Explore unit testing frameworks for front-end/back-end software, if applicable. Document user stories and test cases for games, if applicable. Document data structures and algorithm decisions for data science, if applicable.
        - Add either developer or user documentation to the Open Source documentation site. (Hint: Developer docs often include API docs, architecture or system state diagrams, or deployment guides)
        - Identify a Code of Conduct for any public Open Source repositories. Upload it to public source code repositories. Create internal documentation for how to respond to a Code of Conduct report, if one were to be made.
    - Milestone 3 [Communications and Branding]
        - 1 image + caption per month to be shared on your social media channels

- Quarter 3
    - Milestone 1 [Investigation of the social impact of connectivity]
        - Data Acquisition 
        - Exploratory analysis of data
        - Investigation of social impact of connectivity via  machine learning models
        - Exibition of results in the Web Page
    - Milestone 2 [Communications and Branding]
        - 1 image + caption per month to be shared on your social media channels
    - Milestone 3 [Meeting Open Source Contractual Requirement]
        - Advance Open Source quality assurance. Set up a Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline from source code repository. Set up checks or tests on new Pull Requests. Target 40% code coverage, if applicable
        - Use a public project management board to track progress on public tickets/issues (e.g. Taiga, GitHub/GitLab Projects, JIRA, Trello, or similar)
        - Advance Open Source quality assurance. Target 40% code coverage for unit tests, if applicable
        - Review compliance against DPG criteria and address any gaps

- Quarter 4
    - Milestone 1 [Tool for studying the social impact of connectivity in schools]
        - Component for data acquisiton
        - Component with the analytical models
        - Component for use interface
        - Update webpage
    - Milestone 2 [Communications and Branding]
        - 1 image + caption per month to be shared on your social media channels
        - 1 blog post at end of quarter
    - Milestone 3 [Meeting Open Source Contractual Requirement]
        - Finalize Open Source documentation. User and developer documentation should be available
        - Finalize Open Source quality assurance. Achieve 80% code test coverage, if applicable
