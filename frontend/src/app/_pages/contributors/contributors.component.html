  <!-- ABOUT COMMUNITY -->
  <section>
    <h3>About the community</h3>
    <p>We are currently building an intelligence platform that uses data-sets inputs (connectivity, social, economic and
      employability) to predict social impacts in a region due to connectivity investments. We believe connectivity
      leverages access to new opportunities and better education that impacts people’s futures. on a project that
      addresses hate speech by providing victims and observers micro-interventions that help them choose strategic
      silence and counter narratives to combat perpetrators in a healthy and productive way.</p>

    <p>We will also offer techniques to provide instant relief to people that have been attacked to help them overcome
      this challenging situation and prevent mental wellbeing issues.</p>

    <p>
      And we will create a Chat Story or Chat Game to raise awareness about the growth of Hate Speech and all the
      possibilities we have as a community to stop this trend from scaling by changing our attitude and online behavior.
    </p>

  <!-- PROBLEM -->
  <section>
    <h3>Problem to solve and why apply Data Sciense method?</h3>
    <p>By identifying schools with low or no connectivity we may help to bring connectivity to them and, hence, changing
      the destiny of their students by including them in the digital world and giving them access to information.</p>

    <p>Digital education will help people´s development by improving their employability and giving them better chances
      for new opportunities. Education is the best tool to change the world.</p>

    <p>
      We use data science techniques to collect and deduplicate a huge amount of information (job pots for example) from
      many different sources. In particular, deduplication is a non-trivial task so that modern techniques are required
      to understand and extract information from data in a highly scalable way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our solution uses Machine Learning techniques, in particular, those developed in the subfield of Natural Language
      Processing, to extract and normalize relevant entities that are present in many sources like job descriptions as
      job titles.
    </p>

    <p>
      We also use Machine Learning techniques to build explainable models to predict connectivity at schools. To find
      the model(s) that will be implemented in our service we will invest in feature selection/engineering and we will
      also carry-on experiments with a number of possibilities ranging from classical models (Learners) as Decision
      Trees and SVM's to more recent ones, including Gradient Boosting Methods and Deep Learning.

  <!-- REPORTING BUG -->
  <section>
    <h3>Reporting Bugs</h3>
    <h4>Before Submitting a Bug Report</h4>
    <p>A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to
      investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the
      following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Make sure that you are using the latest version.</li>
      <li>Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment
        components/versions.</li>
      <li>To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check
        if
        there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the <a
          href="https://github.com/Jobzi-Artificial-Intelligence/unicef-project/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Abug+"
          target="_blank">bug tracker</a>.</li>
      <li>Collect information about the bug.</li>
      <li>Stack trace.</li>
      <li>OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM).</li>
      <li>Browser version</li>
      <li>Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to
          the
          issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to <a
            href="mailto:contato@jobzi.com?subject=Jobzi | Unicef - Schools Connectivity">contato@jobzi.com</a></i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>


    <p>We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Open an <a href="https://github.com/Jobzi-Artificial-Intelligence/unicef-project/issues/new"
          target="_blank">Issue</a>.</li>
      <li>Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.</li>
      <li>Please provide as much context as possible and describe the reproduction steps that someone else can follow to
        recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the
        problem and create a reduced test case.</li>
      <li>Provide the information you collected in the previous section.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Once it's filed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The project team will label the issue accordingly.</li>
      <li>A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or
        no
        obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps.</li>
      <li>If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked <span class="f-weight-500">Bug</span>, and the
        issue will be left to be
        implemented by someone.</li>
    </ul>
